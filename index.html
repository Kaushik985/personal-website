                    <h3>A Glimpse of Kaushik</h3>
                        <p>
                            As a rising senior in Frisco High School, I am partaking in activities such as acting and debating. I have earned many state and district awards for acting, as I find this a way to express my personality and vibrancy. Additionally, I'm adequately educated in the field of Computer Science, coding, and learning Java in my Computer Science class. I also partake in a club, Destination Imagination, where I perform and work in constrained/low-state environments such as activities like improv-acting and engineering challenges. As a 1st Decided Black Belt in Taekwondo, I've honed my skills to gain skills of discipline and focus. Currently, I'm in a unique club, Independent Study and Mentorship, aiming to indulge in the realm of Real Estate and improve my financial literacy. Additionally, I manage clubs such as Lightbulb Tutoring and The American Red Cross Society. In this ISM journey, I strive to seek amicable guidance that will assist me in my Real Estate endeavors along the way.
